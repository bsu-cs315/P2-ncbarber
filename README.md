## Reflection

I think that this project I took a big leap into these different outside tools that I could use in order to make some really nice assets for a project. 
I had a lot of fun working on making little tunes as well as animations and working with particles.
Overall this iteration showed me that I am able to figure out a lot of the ideas that I want to do for a basic game like this.
I am really looking forward to building more things that I but this level of ideas and creativity into. 

## Juice

First Item added for juice was particles for the character, as well as particles for the coins.

- [X] C-9: The player's character falls down when walking off a ledge.
- [X] C-10: Include a full player experience loop: title, gameplay, end.
- [X] B-1: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a personal reflection on the iteration and self-evaluation, as defined above.
- [X] B-2: The source code and project structure comply with our adopted style guides.
- [X] B-3: There is a sprite element in the level that the player can interact with, such as a collectible, an enemy, a book, or a switch.
- [X] B-4: The camera follows the character through a world that is larger than one screen.
- [X] B-5: Include sound effects and music.
- [X] B-6: Include a HUD that tracks game-appropriate data such as score or time remaining.

- [X] A-1: Generate neither warnings nor errors at runtime.
- [ ] A-2: Include two clear examples of <em>juice</em> and describe them in the <code>README.md</code>.
